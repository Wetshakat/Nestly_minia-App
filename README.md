Nestly — The Onchain Tourism Explorer

Built on Base. Built for explorers.

**Overview**

Nestly is the onchain travel discovery and booking platform redefining how people explore
the world.
Built natively on Base, Nestly connects travelers to verified local guides and authentic
attractions, bringing trust, transparency, and ownership to global tourism.

**The Problem**

Every year, over 150 million travelers spend more than $1.4 trillion exploring the world.
But the industry remains broken:
- Fake or unverified guides
- High platform and booking fees
- Zero transparency or accountability
Travelers deserve better — and Web3 makes it possible.

**The Solution — Nestly**

Nestly brings tourism onchain:
- Discover verified local attractions
- Connect directly with trusted guides
- Record, verify, and own every experience onchain
No middlemen. No scams. Just real travel, powered by Base.

**Why Onchain**

Trust & Transparency — Every guide and experience is verified onchain
Ownership — Your trips become digital collectibles, forever yours
Instant Payments — Direct, borderless, low-fee transactions via Base
Empowerment — Local guides earn fairly, without platform exploitation.

**Why Base**

Base offers the speed, scalability, and simplicity needed to take Nestly global:
- Ultra-low fees and high-speed transactions
- Ethereum-grade security
- Developer-friendly tooling and ecosystem
- Scalable infrastructure built for millions of explorers.
  
**Market Opportunity**
- $1.4 trillion global tourism economy
- 150M+ yearly travelers
- 70% of travelers want authentic local experiences
- Onchain tourism = untapped trillion-dollar frontier
Nestly sits at the intersection of Web3 and global travel — a market ready for disruption.

**Business Model
Revenue Streams:**

1. Commission on Bookings — Small onchain service fee per transaction.

3. NFT-Based Experience Collectibles — Earns a small percentage from secondary sales.

5. Loyalty & Rewards Layer — Base-native rewards for long-term growth.

**Mission & Vision**
